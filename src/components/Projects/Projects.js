The longer and more complex the words formed, the higher the score. It requires quick thinking and a strong command of vocabulary to succeed.
              The game often provides a grid or a list of all possible words that can be formed from the given set of letters. This helps players keep track of their progress and discover words they might have missed. Additionally, some versions of Scramble offer power-ups or bonuses that can be used to gain advantages, such as extra time or hints."
